# Laravel + React Starter Kit

## Introduction

Our React starter kit provides a robust, modern starting point for building Laravel applications with a React frontend using [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Inertia allows you to build modern, single-page React applications using classic server-side routing and controllers. This lets you enjoy the frontend power of React combined with the incredible backend productivity of Laravel and lightning-fast Vite compilation.

This React starter kit utilizes React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind, and the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) and [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com) component libraries.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

3. **Database Setup**
   
   For SQLite (default):

   touch database/database.sqlite
   php artisan migrate
   ```
   
   For MySQL/PostgreSQL, update your `.env` file with database credentials and run:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

4. **Build Frontend Assets**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or for development
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Start Development Server**
